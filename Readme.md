## Introduction

Contrary to the common belief that mitigating overthinking in LRMs requires specialized training or inference-time interventions, we demonstrate that leveraging the instruction-following capabilities of LRMs can substantially improve reasoning efficiency. By treating both LRMs and closed-source APIs as black-box communicators, we introduce ***AdvPrompt***, an iterative refinement framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse perspectives, to elicit concise responses while maintaining reasoning performance.

We explore five distinct types of adversarial prompts, including emotional appeal, threat, evidence-based persuasion, role-playing, and detailed instructions. Experiments demonstrate that AdvPrompt consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably, it achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on GSM8K questions for Qwen3, and delivers an average 40% token reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5.

## Update

**2025.10.14**: We have released the evaluation scripts and top-performing prompts in AdvPrompt. Check it out!

## Todo

- [ ] Release instructions and scripts for prompt candidate evaluation

## Installation

```
conda create advprompt python=3.10
conda activate advprompt
cd AdvPrompt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install flash_attn --no-build-isolation
cd latex2sympy
pip install -e .
```

## Evaluation

Modify and run command lines in `sh/qwen3/eval_qwen3.sh`, the results will be stored in `output/`.

```
bash sh/qwen3/eval_qwen3.sh
```
